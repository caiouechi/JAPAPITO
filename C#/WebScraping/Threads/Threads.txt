System.Threading.Thread 

Access the thread using -> CurrentThread 

ThreadStart() -> parameter is a public static void method();

To create a thread:
1) ThreadStart()
2) Thread using ThreadStart as parameter
3) good practice name the threads
4) debugger just see one threads, in this time, the other ones are being executed. if you want you just double click in the threads panel
5) to debug a specific thread -> if condition System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.Name == "blablaba"

xxxxx
thread.Sleep(); (the sleeps, make the thing literally sleeps for a while, then keeps executing)
thread.abort();


Debug treads -> debug -> threads
