1) In the app specifications, it doesn't mention to store the saved list on the client side. However, I thought 
it would be a great experience for the user if he goes back to the application and sees his previous favourite list.

2) I realise some objects from the rest API are coming with no id, so I always verify by name and id

3) Extra treatment for no records found.

4) Treatment for keywords in lowercase or uppercase.

5) Advanced Unit tests -> scenario1 -> find some results, favourite some products, search again and check if the products come with green star

6) Advanced Unit tests -> scenario2 -> favourite the product, check if it appears in the favourite list. Close the browser, and check if the favourite list remains.

7) Advanced Unit tests -> scenario3 -> Search the product, favourite it, and then unfavorite from the favourite list, check if the product in the search results will update automatically
